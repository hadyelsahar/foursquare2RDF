Contributors
------------

Thanks to the following people who have helped in the development process or whose suggestions have led to 
improvements in the code:

- Eamon Nerbonne for the BlockingStreamReader fix (http://eamon.nerbonne.org/) which is much nicer than the
  alternative of pre-caching in a MemoryStream
- Hugh Williams and Jacqui Hand of OpenLink Software (http://www.openlinksw.com) for helping me resolve some
  issues with their ADO.Net provider including promptly providing me with a fixed version once the issue
  I'd identified had been traced to it's cause and extending my evaluation license so I could build the code
- Toby Inkster (http://tobyinkster.co.uk/) for providing me with some TriX extensibility stylesheets that I 
  could use to test my TriX parser
- Marek Safar from the Mono project for fixing the bug in gmcs I identified which meant I couldn't compile
  a Mono build of dotNetRDF
